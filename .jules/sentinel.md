## 2024-05-15 - Unsanitized Href in HTML Extraction
**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, and `data:` URIs in extracted `<a>` tag `href` attributes.
**Learning:** While the DOM parser and HTML sanitization process enforce a strict tag whitelist, attributes kept on whitelisted tags (like `href` on `<a>`) can still carry dangerous payloads. Attackers can bypass naive checks using control characters (e.g. `java\nscript:`).
**Prevention:** Always validate and sanitize URLs before rendering them into attributes. Strip control characters from URLs before checking their scheme, and reject unsafe schemes (like `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, and `data:`).
